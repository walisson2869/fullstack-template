# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install      # install dependencies
pnpm dev          # dev server → http://localhost:3000
pnpm build        # production build (also runs TypeScript check)
pnpm start        # serve production build
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm test         # Vitest — unit + component tests
pnpm test:watch   # Vitest watch mode (use during TDD)
pnpm test:ui      # Vitest browser UI
```

## Project structure

```
app/                  # Next.js App Router — routes only
  layout.tsx          # root layout: Geist fonts, global CSS, <html>/<body>
  page.tsx            # home page (Server Component)
  globals.css         # Tailwind v4 import + CSS variable definitions
public/               # static assets
components/           # shared UI components (create when needed)
lib/                  # utilities and non-React helpers (create when needed)
types/                # shared TypeScript type definitions (create when needed)
```

## Detailed documentation

Read the relevant doc before implementing. These are kept in sync with the code — prefer them over general Next.js knowledge when they conflict.

## Testing instructions

**TDD is required.** Write failing tests first, then implement.

### Framework
- **Vitest** + **@testing-library/react** + **jsdom** for unit and component tests.
- `next/image` and other Next.js built-ins are aliased to lightweight mocks in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Server Component rendering requires Playwright E2E (not yet set up) — test logic separately.

### What to test
- All functions in `lib/` must have Vitest unit tests.
- All Client Components (`"use client"`) must have render tests.
- Server Components: extract and test any logic; rendering is covered by E2E.

### Patterns
```tsx
// Component test
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import MyButton from '@/components/MyButton'

it('renders label', () => {
  render(<MyButton label="Save" />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// Utility test
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/format'

it('formats ISO date', () => {
  expect(formatDate('2026-01-15')).toBe('Jan 15, 2026')
})
```

### Quality gate — all must pass before committing
```bash
pnpm test     # no failing tests
pnpm lint     # no ESLint errors
pnpm build    # no TypeScript errors, no build failures
```

See [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) for full setup details and conventions.

## Key conventions (short version — see docs for full detail)

- **App Router only** — never create a `pages/` directory
- **Server Components by default** — add `"use client"` only for browser APIs or React hooks; push it to the smallest possible component
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — no CSS modules, no inline `style={}`, no other CSS frameworks
- **No `any`** — use proper interfaces or `unknown`
- **Data fetching** — fetch in Server Components or Server Actions, not in client-side `useEffect`
- **Backend calls** — go through Server Components or Server Actions; never fetch `localhost:8080` from client components
